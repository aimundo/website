bio: My research interests include the longitudinal evolution of tumor response to treatment and statistical methods to analyze such evolution. I am also interested in research reproducibility in Biomedical Engineering.

I am a PhD Student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville. Curiosity (and necessity) led me to take a class in the Geosciences Department to learn to use R. Little I knew that that class would change my view of Statistics and to question how data is traditionally analyzed in biomedical research. I am interested in novel approaches to analyze longitudinal data, and I try to make research reproducibility a core component of my work.
