<div id="why-dont-you-try-rmarkdown-and-moving-to-bookdown" class="section level1">
<h1>“Why don’t you try RMarkdown?” and moving to Bookdown</h1>
<p>A while ago I started to work on a manuscript and in a meeting with one of the co-authors he said “Why don’t you try RMarkdown to write this project?”. Until that moment, I had only used Word to write scientific documents, and a quick look on the Internet confirmed my initial suspicion that using RMarkdown was a complete change from using Word. Nonetheless, I also had a feeling that learning to do things in RMarkdown <em>had</em> to be beneficial, so I decided that it was worth to give it a shot. If I didn’t like how things were going after a week, I would go back to Word.</p>
<p>Fast forward a couple days later and I realize that I need to cross-reference an equation in the manuscript. A Google search indicates that to do this, I should probably use <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/">Bookdown</a>. A quick glimpse on the Bookdown manual also indicates that Bookdown offers more capabilities than RMarkdown to reference equation and figures. As I work on the manuscript I find that using Bookdown is way more easy that doing things in Word. Equations? Easy, and unlike the equations made in Word, here they look gorgeous, textbook-like. Citations? A small learning curve, but you know what you are doing and you control the amount of information you have for each reference. The list of benefits goes on and on.</p>
<p>However, the day comes when I have to add the author information on the manuscript (which hencefort I will call <code>Manuscript.Rmd</code>). There are three authors, two of which (including myself) are from the same academic institution. I try the option of listing the authors in the YAML header like this (title and author information in this case are fake):</p>

subtitle: _Political and sociological considerations_

<p>The main problem here is that when rendered, the header looks like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Header_1.JPG" alt="header-1" />
<p class="caption">header-1</p>
</div>
<p>While the footnote looks like this:
<img src="footnote_1.JPG" alt="footnote-1" /></p>
<p>Its clear that every author is being assigned a “different” institution, I think I was naive enough to think that Bookdown will “detect” that two of the authors were in the same institution, but of course, that is not the case.</p>
<p>I couldn’t find a satisfactory answer to this problem in the Bookdown Cookbook, but by looking through the internet I find that there is a <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> package called <code>authblk</code> that allows for better control on the author information. This search leads me to <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/12/author-with-affiliation-in-bookdown-html-and-pdf/">this</a> post on Rbloggers with a proposed solution. However, the syntax that the post offers does not work for me, and after multiple attempts, I am starting to think that I would probably have to submit a question about this in some specialized forum (which would involve creating a <code>reprex</code>, creating an account, registering, and the list goes on…).</p>
<p>A couple more hours of reading and I discover (yes, I know this is pretty well known for some people, but it felt like a great discover to me, nonetheless) that more control over the creation of the document can be achieved by using a <code>.sty</code> file. In short, the <code>.sty</code> file can contain some <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> code that allows to customize the final document (longer explanation <a href="http://dw.tug.org/pracjourn/2005-3/asknelly/nelly-sty-&amp;-cls.pdf">here</a>). This is really convenient as it allows to do other things such as adding line numbers to the document.</p>
<p>To make the story short, I ended up doing this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating a <code>.sty</code> file called “preamble” that is the same directory where <code>Manuscript.Rmd</code>
is.</li>
<li>In <code>preamble.sty</code> I wrote the following:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>\usepackage{lineno}
\usepackage{authblk}

%command for the package lineno to put line numbers in the manuscript
\linenumbers

%authors
\author[1]{Benicio del Ox}
\author[2]{Jake A. Motaungh}
\author[1]{Frederick P. Montego}
\affil[1]{\footnotesize Department of Sociology, University of the Insula}
\affil[2]{\footnotesize Department of Psychology, University of Mars}
</code></pre>
<p>Then, in the YAML header of <code>Manuscript.Rmd</code> I added two lines to indicate that I will call <code>preamble.sty</code> when the PDF is compiled:</p>
