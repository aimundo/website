<p>Disclaimer: I am writing this Blog in hopes that what I’ve learned helps someone else, but I also do it as a cathartic component of the learning process. So dear reader, please bear with me while I narrate my journey…</p>
<div id="why-dont-you-try-rmarkdown-and-moving-to-bookdown" class="section level1">
<h1>“Why don’t you try RMarkdown?” and moving to Bookdown</h1>
<p>A while ago I started to work on a manuscript, and during a meeting with the co-authors one of them said “Why don’t you try RMarkdown to write this project?”. Until that moment, I had only used Word to write scientific documents, and a quick look on the Internet confirmed my initial suspicion that using RMarkdown was a complete different experience than using Word. Nonetheless, I also had a feeling that learning to do things in RMarkdown <em>had</em> to be beneficial, so I decided that it was worth to give it a shot. If I didn’t like how things were going after a week, I would go back to Word.</p>
<p>Fast forward a couple days later and I’m starting to understand how things work on RMarkdown, and I also realize that I need to cross-reference an equation in the manuscript. A Google search indicates that to do this, I should probably use <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/">Bookdown</a>. A quick glimpse on the Bookdown manual also indicates that Bookdown offers more capabilities than RMarkdown to reference equations and figures. So I start working on Bookdown. As I work on the manuscript more and more, I find that using Bookdown is substantially more beneficial to write a document than Word. Equations? Easy, and unlike the equations made in Word, here they look gorgeous, textbook-like. Citations? A small learning curve, but you understand what you are doing and control the amount of information you have for each reference. Above all, one of the major advantages is that when creating figures in R you don’t have to mess with importing the figure and fighting with its placement in the document, which is always a pain in Word!</p>
<p>However, the day comes when I have to add the author information on the manuscript (which hencefort I will call <code>Manuscript.Rmd</code>). There are three authors, two of which (including myself) are from the same academic institution. I try the option of listing the authors in the YAML header as the Bookdown manual suggests (title and author information in this case are fake):</p>

<p>The main problem here is that when rendered, the header looks like this:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="Header_1.JPG" alt="header-1" />
<p class="caption">header-1</p>
</div>
<p>While the footnote looks like this:
<img src="footnote_1.JPG" alt="footnote-1" /></p>
<p>Its clear that every author is being assigned a “different” institution. I was naive enough to think that Bookdown would “detect and merge” the affiliation of twor or more authors when it was the same, but that was clearly not the case.</p>
<p>I couldn’t find a satisfactory answer to this problem in the Bookdown Cookbook, but by looking through the internet I found that there is a <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> package called <code>authblk</code> that allows for better control on the author information. This search also leads me to <a href="https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/12/author-with-affiliation-in-bookdown-html-and-pdf/">this</a> post on Rbloggers with a proposed solution on how to use <code>authblk</code> in a Bookdown document. However, the syntax that the post offers didn’t work for me, and after multiple attempts, I started to think that I would probably have to submit a question about this issue in some specialized forum (which would involve creating a <code>reprex</code>, creating an account, registering, and the list goes on…).</p>
<p>After reading for a while again, I discover (yes, I know this is pretty well to almost anyone, but it felt like a great discover to me, nonetheless) that more control over the creation of the document can be achieved by using a <code>.sty</code> file. In short, the <code>.sty</code> file can contain some <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> code that allows to customize the final document (longer explanation <a href="http://dw.tug.org/pracjourn/2005-3/asknelly/nelly-sty-&amp;-cls.pdf">here</a>). This discovery was really convenient as this approach would allow me add line numbers, which is something I also wanted to do on the document.</p>
<p>So I proceeded as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Creating a <code>.sty</code> file called “preamble” that was the same directory where <code>Manuscript.Rmd</code> was located.</p></li>
<li><p>In <code>preamble.sty</code>:</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>\usepackage{lineno}
\usepackage{authblk}

\author[1]{Frederick P. Montego}
\affil[1]{\footnotesize Department of Sociology, University of the Insula}
\affil[2]{\footnotesize Department of Psychology, University of Mars}
</code></pre>
<p>Then, in the YAML header of <code>Manuscript.Rmd</code> I added two lines to indicate that <span class="math inline">\(\LaTeX\)</span> code is in <code>preamble.sty</code>. The two lines are <code>includes</code> and <code>in_header</code>:</p>
